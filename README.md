## 🛠️ XUI.one Decompiled Source Code – For Developers

As an extra resource, we now offer a **partially deobfuscated** version of **XUI.one 1.5.13** with source code – available for **free download**.

This version is intended for developers and advanced users who wish to:

* Extend the panel functionality
* Implement new modules and APIs
* Understand how internal logic works
* Improve or clean the codebase

### 🔍 Example Source Snippet:

```php
goto label1944;

label1:
if (isset(XUI::$rRequest['server_id'])) {
    goto label1258;
}
$Cc2b5dfe75dc164b = 3600;
$Ab13f2545dd3df14 = time();
$fa59d8fa25ff8bf2 = $Ab13f2545dd3df14 - $Cc2b5dfe75dc164b;
goto label1371;
```

This is a typical obfuscated logic block using `goto` statements. While functional, it’s not easily readable or maintainable. **Manual cleaning is required**, and we encourage the community to participate in refactoring and improving the source code collaboratively.

🔬 In the future, we’ll release a **fully cleaned version** once the obfuscation is fully reversed and validated.
